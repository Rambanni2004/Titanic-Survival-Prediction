# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Objective:
This project uses machine learning to predict the survival status of Titanic passengers based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin information.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, such as their survival status, age, gender, ticket class, fare, and embarked location.

The dataset is available in the `data/` folder as `tested.csv`. You can also download the dataset from [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Project Structure:
- **data/**: Folder containing the dataset file `tested.csv`.
- **notebook/**: Folder containing the Jupyter notebook `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb` with code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: This file describing the project.


## Steps to Run the Project:

You can clone this entire repository using the command below. Also, you need to download the dataset, which is included in the /data folder.

**Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
```

Create a new notebook in Google Colab and upload the Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb file.

## Conclusion:
In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict the survival of Titanic passengers using the Logistic Regression algorithm. The model utilized various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and embarkation port, which were carefully preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical data, and normalize numerical features.

After training and evaluating the model, we achieved a strong performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in solving real-world classification problems and provides a solid foundation for further exploration into more complex models.

Feel free to explore, improve, and extend this project to enhance the model's performance or apply it to other datasets!
