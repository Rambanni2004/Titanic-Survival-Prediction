# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, based on features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin information, and more. The project uses the Titanic dataset and applies various data preprocessing steps, model training, and performance evaluation.

### Dataset

The dataset used is a version of the Titanic passenger data available on Kaggle. It contains several columns with information about passengers, including whether they survived the Titanic disaster or not.

### Task Objectives

- Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
- Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical data.
- Evaluate the performance of the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
